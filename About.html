      <p>
        ONE OK ROCK is a Japanese rock band formed in 2005 and debuted in 2007.
        ONE OK ROCK has cultivated a following among the youth for their mix of
        emo and rock music paired with breathtaking live performances. The
        band's name, ONE OK ROCK, comes from "one o'clock", the time that the
        band used to practice on weekends. They chose to play at one o'clock in
        the morning because it was cheaper to use the rehearsal space during
        such hours. However, noticing that the Japanese language made no
        distinction between R's and L's, they changed "O'CLOCK" to "O'CROCK" (or
        "O'KROCK"), which was then separated to become "OK ROCK". In addition,
        ONE OK ROCK's name can be expressed as "10969" (one-o-ku-ro(ku)-ku).
